Welcome to CS50 Quizzer!

CS50 Quizzer is a web-based program that allows people to create online single-question or multiple-question
(questions are all multiple-choice) quizzes. When a user creates a quiz, they can pass the unique test-id of
their quiz to other users who can then answer the questions. Once the attempt is complete, the person taking
the quiz will immediately be shown their percentage score; futhermore, all attempts to answer each quewtion
are logged in the test-creator's answer log. The program is written using the Flask framework; all the server-side
code is written in python, and html, jinja, and javascript have been used to write the client-side code.
